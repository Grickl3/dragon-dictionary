The center content is swapped instantaneously <em>(looking at the navigation elements you'll notice that they do not blink when the center content changes)</em>. However, that swapping can be — and should be — designed into an elegant transition <em>(a fade or motion effect)</em>, an easy but not simple task because of the component based nature of the interface.</p>";
